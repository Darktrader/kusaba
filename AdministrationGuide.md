      * The "Is Regex" Checkbox is an advanced feature to allow for highly customized wordfilters
        * It uses the preg\_replace() function of php, so check php.net for proper syntax
          * Using Regex wordfilters can be dangerous, and may render it impossible to post on your site. Be careful when activating these filters
